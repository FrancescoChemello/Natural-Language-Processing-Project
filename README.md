# NAME ENTITY RECOGNITION - NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING #
Natural Language Processing - 2024/25

## Overview ##
This project implements the **named-entity recognition (NER)**, a task that detects segments of a sentence in which a person name, a company name, a location name, etc, using **zero-shot techniques**. For this project it is used [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs?hl=it).
This project takes inspiration from the paper [Empirical Study of Zero-Shot NER with ChatGPT by Xie et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10035). 

This repository is a template repository for the homeworks to be developed in the [Natural Language Processing](https://stem.elearning.unipd.it/course/view.php?id=9624) course.

*Natural Language Processing* is a course of the [Master Degree in Computer Engineering](https://degrees.dei.unipd.it/master-degrees/computer-engineering/) of the  [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.dei.unipd.it/en/), [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/), Italy.
